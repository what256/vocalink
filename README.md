🎤 VocalInk

VocalInk is a blazing-fast, privacy-friendly desktop voice-to-text app that transcribes your speech into text in real time and pastes it directly where you’re typing. It works with customizable hotkeys, a minimal tray icon, and runs silently in the background.

🚀 Why VocalInk?

Not everyone can afford expensive commercial tools like Aqua Voice or Otter — VocalInk was built to give everyone free access to real-time speech-to-text transcription with the same power, speed, and convenience, but open-source and offline-first. No subscriptions, no cloud processing, and your data stays on your machine.
